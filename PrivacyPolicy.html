    <h1>Octavo Reader Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> August 2025</p>
    
    <div class="highlight no-data">
        <strong>Privacy First Promise:</strong> Octavo Reader is designed with your privacy as the top priority. We do not collect, store, or transmit any personal data or usage analytics.
    </div>

    <h2>1. Information We Do NOT Collect</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Personal Information:</strong> We do not collect names, email addresses, phone numbers, or any other personal identifiers</li>
        <li><strong>Usage Analytics:</strong> We do not track how you use the app, which documents you open, or your reading patterns</li>
        <li><strong>Device Information:</strong> We do not collect device identifiers, operating system details, or hardware specifications</li>
        <li><strong>Location Data:</strong> We do not access or collect any location information</li>
        <li><strong>User Accounts:</strong> We do not maintain user accounts or authentication systems</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. How Your Documents Are Processed</h2>
    <h3>Local Processing</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>PDF documents are processed entirely on your device using Apple's PDFKit framework</li>
        <li>Text extraction and OCR (when needed) are performed locally using Apple's Vision framework</li>
        <li>Document content never leaves your device unless explicitly sent for AI translation</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>AI Translation and Summary Services</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>When you use the AI translation feature, <strong>only the selected text paragraph</strong> is sent to your chosen AI service provider</li>
        <li>When you use the AI summary feature, <strong>only the extracted text content</strong> (limited to 100,000 characters by default, configurable up to 200,000 in settings) is sent to generate a summary</li>
        <li>We never send the complete PDF document, images, or any document metadata</li>
        <li>All text extraction is performed locally on your device using Apple's PDFKit</li>
        <li>You must provide your own API keys for AI services (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, etc.)</li>
        <li>Your API keys are stored securely in your device's Keychain and never transmitted to us</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Third-Party AI Services</h2>
    <p>When you choose to use AI translation or summary features:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Selected text is sent directly from your device to your chosen AI provider using your API key</li>
        <li>Octavo Reader acts only as a conduit - we do not process, store, or access this data</li>
        <li>Each AI provider has their own privacy policy governing how they handle the text you send</li>
        <li>You can disable AI features entirely and use Octavo Reader as a local-only PDF reader</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Data Storage</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Local Only:</strong> All app data is stored locally on your device</li>
        <li><strong>No Cloud Storage:</strong> We do not sync or backup any data to our servers</li>
        <li><strong>Translation Cache:</strong> Translation results may be cached locally to improve performance - this data never leaves your device</li>
        <li><strong>Settings:</strong> Your preferences and API key configurations are stored locally in your device's secure storage</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Network Usage</h2>
    <p>Octavo Reader connects to the internet only for:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Downloading PDF documents from arXiv or other URLs you provide</li>
        <li>Sending selected text to AI services when you explicitly request translation or summary generation (using your API keys)</li>
        <li>Checking for app updates through the App Store</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Permissions</h2>
    <p>Octavo Reader may request the following permissions:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>File Access:</strong> To open PDF documents from your device, iCloud, or other file providers</li>
        <li><strong>Network Access:</strong> To download PDFs from URLs and communicate with AI services</li>
        <li><strong>No other permissions are required or requested</strong></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Since we do not collect any personal information, our app is safe for users of all ages. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.</p>

    <h2>8. Data Security</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>All local data is protected by iOS security features including device encryption</li>
        <li>API keys are stored in iOS Keychain with appropriate security attributes</li>
        <li>No data is transmitted to Octavo Reader servers because we don't operate any servers</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>9. Your Control</h2>
    <p>You have complete control over your data:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>All data is stored locally on your device</li>
        <li>You can delete the app at any time to remove all associated data</li>

        <li>You control which AI services to use through your own API key configuration</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>10. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>If we make changes to this privacy policy, we will update the "Last Updated" date and notify users through app updates. Given our no-data-collection approach, any changes will maintain the same privacy-first principles.</p>
